# Java

> Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent,
> class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few
> implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application
> developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code
> can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

## Why Java

Over the past couple years I have worked mainly with Ruby, Python, Javascript
and Swift. One of the major drawbacks for me wasn't the fact that they are
dynamically typed but that they change incredibly fast. This is especially true
for Javascript. My personal interest with Java is to have a stable language
in my toolbox which doesn't require me to learn always the latest frameworks
and libraries.

## My Goals with Java

As I was reading about Java I have up goals for myself which I want to keep
track of:

- Learn Spring
- Build GUI Applications (JavaFX)
- Work with Big Data (Hadoop)
- Machine Learning (Deeplearning4j, Elki, JavaML)
- Visual Arts (processing)
